John, by the grace of God King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and Count of Anjou, to his
archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justiciaries, foresters, sheriffs, stewards, servants, and to all his
officials and loyal subjects, greeting.
Know that we, at the prompting of God and for the health of our soul and those of our ancestors and heirs, to the
honour of God, the exaltation of the holy Church, and the better ordering of our kingdom, at the advice of our reverend
 fathers Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all England, and cardinal of the holy Roman Church.
No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived
 of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the
 lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land.
To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice. All merchants may enter or leave England unharmed and
 without fear, and may stay or travel within it, by land or water, for purposes of trade, free from all illegal
  exactions, in accordance with ancient and lawful customs.
